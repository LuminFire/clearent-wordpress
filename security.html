        <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your WordPress site must use HTTPS.</li>
            <li>Do not publish your API Key or share it with anyone.</li>
            <li>Never store or displayed non-encrypted card data anywhere on your site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Response Validation</h3>

        <h4>Successful Transactions</h4>

        <p>After each transaction request, the browser will receive a response from the Clearent transaction processing portal. If the transaction request was successful,
        the application looks for a callback function named "ClearentOnSuccess" and if found, calls this function. The function receives two parameters, the raw, signed
        response from the server (see "Clearent WordPress Plugin Verification" below) and a JSON object representation of the the raw response. In the example below,
        we created a function to log the raw response, the JSON-formatted response, and the transaction id to the browser's developer console.</p>


        <p>You will pass this raw response to your server side solution to complete the transaction. Because the response comes from Clearent to the
            client-browser and then up to your server, you cannot trust that the response has not been tampered with. <strong>Never trust client-side data!</strong></p>
        <p> There are multiple ways to validate the response from the browser to insure that the response has not been tampered with and that you have indeed charged and received the expected amount from the client</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The response will contain a hash signature that can be used to validate the response. The hash is made up of the response object. You can validate the signature on your server to validate the response parameters were not
                tampered
                with. This is imperative to your ensuring your transaction is valid. Make sure the response is valid AND that the transaction Id is unique.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Clearent/HPPSignatureVerification">Clearent WordPress Plugin Verification</a></li>
            <li>You can use our API to do a GET with the transaction ID to ensure the response matches what the client side passed you. Each transaction ID is unique so once you have accepted a transaction ID for payment, you should never
                see the
                same transaction ID again.
            </li>
            <li>You can validate the transactions manually using the Virtual Terminal. Again, you can search by transaction ID to validate the transaction details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Failed Transactions</h4>

        <p>If the transaction was not successful, the browser will receive a response from the Clearent transaction processing portal containing an error message. The user
            will see a generic error message: <strong>"We were unable to process your payment. Please verify your card details and try again or contact us to complete your order."</strong>
            This <a href="configuration.html">error message can be configured</a> with different text if necessary.
            </p>

        <p>For failed transactions, the application looks for a callback function named "ClearentOnError" and if found,
            calls this function. This function also receives the same two parameters as the ClearentOnSuccess function; the raw, signed response from the server (see "Clearent Hosted Payment
            Page Verification" below) and a JSON object representation of the the raw response.</p>

        <p>In the example below, we created a function to log the raw response, the JSON-formatted response, the error-message (if present) and the
                transaction id (if present) to the browser's developer console. </p>

        <p>Upon examining the response from a failed transaction, you will notice the error messages in the response objects are intentionally vague. This is done
            to prevent scammers from using the service to test cards and security codes. If the card is invalid, or expiration invalid, or security code invalid, the response will simply contain,
            a generic message. You can use the transaction id to look up the transaction details in Virtual Terminal to examine the transaction in more detail.</p>

        <p> The response will not contain
            transaction information if a transaction was not attempted. Possible reasons for non-attempted transactions are invalid or expired public key, or unrecoverable server error. </p>


        <h3>Browser Support</h3>

        <p>
            Clearentâ€™s WordPress Plugin will work with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE10 and higher. It has been designed to work on desktops, notebooks, tablets, and mobile devices.

        </p>

        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

        <p>
            Error messages for this solution are very generic for security purposes as these errors are presented directly to the end user. Please make sure you log the exchange ID from the failed response and provide that to Clearent if
            you have questions about any errors you receive.</p>

        <p>Example:
        <br>
        Exchange ID: <code>ID-CLASBDKRGW01-cgw01-41232-1446575925523-0-2261</code>
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>Client Side CC Validation</h3>

        <p>In accordance with best security practices, all client data is validated on Clearent servers. We do perform basic client-side validation to improve the user-experience and reduce errors.
        </p>

        <h4>Validating card field</h4>

        <p>Credit card numbers are validated on the client as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Card number is present.</li>
            <li> Card is between 13 and 19 characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Validating expiration date</h4>

        <p>Expiration date is required for all transactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Year selected must be greater than current year or</li>
            <li> Year selected must be current year and month selected must be current month or later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Validating CVC</h4>

        <p>By default, the card security code (CSC, CID, CVC, CVV, CVV2) is required for all transactions unless the merchant is storing and presenting card tokens to the user</p>

        <ul>
            <li> If required (see <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a>), security code must be 3 or 4 digits</li>
        </ul>
